## Interface

### Instructor's User-Interface

The instructor interface starts from **index page** (`index.html`) which has the courses listing. From here he/she can go to previous lectures of given course and add new lectures. Upon adding a new lecture they can receive questions from student users who use the student interface. Also, one can review and keep track of the data from previous lectures through the review page.  

Each page has its own JavaScript file which contains the all of the interactions. The `scripts` folder contains these files, which are named in a similar way to their corresponding HTML files.

## Student's User-Interface

This interface has two parts:

* **login page** (`student_login.html`) - for logging in, and
* **index page** (`student_index.html`) - for the student to be able to ask questions in the active lecture.
